## Kickoff Discussion: AXIVO-CLAUDE Conversational AI – Domain Profiles, Protocols & Product Owner Dynamics

Welcome to **axivo-claude-conversational-ai**!

This project aims to chart new territory for collaborative, extensible AXIVO-style domain profiles, protocols, and templates—enabling truly autonomous, proactive conversational AI agents.

**Core Mission:**  
Empower a conversational AI agent or Domain Profile to act as a methodology-driven product owner—capable of turning human ideas into actionable project management, engineering, and development routines, by actively engaging the user, translating ideas into professional methodologies, and generating specifications, workflows, and artifacts.

**What’s included:**
- Domain Profiles for distinct agent roles (Product Owner, Researcher, Engineer, Developer, Humanist, Creative, Translator)
- Protocols for onboarding, logging, role-switching, and SRE/behavioral psychology synergy
- Templates for extending profiles/protocols
- Mechanisms for transparent decision-making, engagement, and error handling

**Key Questions for Contributors:**
- What additional domain profiles or protocols would you find valuable?
- Which onboarding, collaboration, or error-handling scenarios are most challenging for autonomous agents?
- How should agent methodology and product management evolve as we expand from "idea → spec → project"?

**How to get involved:**
- Share feedback, suggestions, and use cases in this thread
- Propose improvements, extensions, or new templates
- Help shape the future of proactive, methodology-driven conversational AI!

Looking forward to your thoughts and contributions!
