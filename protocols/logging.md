# Protocol: Logging for Autonomous Conversational Agents

## Purpose
Document all actions, decisions, protocol switches, errors, and rationale for transparency, audit, and continuous improvement.

## Guidelines
- For each automated action (file change, protocol activation, role switch):
  - Timestamp
  - Active role/expertise
  - Action performed
  - Rationale/context
  - Impact assessment (minor/major/ambiguous)
- Errors, failures, ambiguities: trigger Prompt Designer role and log troubleshooting steps.
- Reference PROMPTS.md as needed.
- Store logs in /diagnostics/ or as commit messages.
